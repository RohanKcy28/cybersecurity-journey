**🧠 What I did today:**

- Finished TryHackMe rooms: *Offensive Security Intro* and *Defensive Security Intro*
- Learned about SOC, SIEM, malware analysis, and basic alert triage
- Practiced Linux terminal basics and OS fundamentals
- Took detailed notes and uploaded all files to GitHub

**💡 What I found interesting:**

- Simulated SIEM alert review — felt like a real SOC environment
- Liked learning how vulnerabilities can be exploited responsibly

**😕 What confused me (for now):**

- How SIEM alerts exactly trigger (need deeper exploration later)

**🔁 What I’ll revisit:**

- Re-do simulation later to reinforce alert analysis
- Practice more Linux commands daily
