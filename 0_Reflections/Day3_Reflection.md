## 🌐 Day 3 Reflection

### 🧠 What I did today:

- Learned the basics of networking: IP addresses, packets, ports, protocols.
- Explored TCP vs UDP, DNS, and the OSI model.
- Practiced diagnostic tools: `ping`, `ipconfig`, `netstat`, `traceroute`, `nslookup`.
- Completed the **TryHackMe - Network Fundamentals** room.
- Took detailed notes in GitHub (`TryHackMe/Day3_NetworkFundamentals.md`) and Notion.

---

### 💡 What I found interesting:

- Understanding how data actually travels in packets across layers.
- The OSI model makes it easier to mentally break down network issues.
- DNS feels like the "Google Maps" of the internet—surprisingly crucial.

---

### 🤔 What confused me (for now):

- Difference between TCP and UDP was a bit abstract at first.
- Port numbers — memorizing common ports is going to take some repetition.

---

### 🔁 What I’ll revisit:

- Review OSI layers again to solidify which protocols map to which layer.
- Make flashcards for common TCP/UDP ports.
- Try network tools (`netstat`, `traceroute`) in more real-world environments.
