### 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

- It’s the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from attacks or unauthorized access
- Goal: Keep systems **private**, **accurate**, and **working** at all times
- Think of it like locking your house + keeping everything safe inside

### 🔒 CIA Triad (Core of Cybersecurity):

1. **Confidentiality** – Only the right people can access data (e.g. passwords, encryption)
2. **Integrity** – Data should stay accurate and unchanged (no tampering)
3. **Availability** – Systems and data must be online and usable when needed (e.g. banking site working 24/7)

### ⚠️ Threat vs Vulnerability vs Risk

- **Threat** = The danger (e.g. hacker, virus, phishing email)
- **Vulnerability** = Weakness in the system (e.g. outdated software, no antivirus)
- **Risk** = The chance that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause damage

Example:

If you don’t lock your door (**vulnerability**), a thief (**threat**) might rob you — that’s the **risk**.

### 🦠 Types of Cyber Attacks

- **Phishing** – Fake emails or links to steal your info
- **Malware** – Harmful software that infects or damages your system
- **DDoS** – Attack that overloads a website with fake traffic and crashes it
- **Ransomware** – Locks your files and demands payment to unlock
- **Brute Force** – Tries all password combinations until it breaks in

### 🏢 What is a SOC?

- **SOC = Security Operations Center**
- A team of people who monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats 24/7
- Like a “security room” for the internet and company systems

### 👨‍💻 What does a SOC Analyst do?

- Monitors alerts and logs
- Detects unusual or dangerous activity
- Investigates attacks (like cyber police)
- Writes reports and helps protect future attacks
- Works in shifts (many SOCs are 24/7)
