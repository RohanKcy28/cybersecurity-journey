## What is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It allows users and applications to interact with the hardware.

## Key Functions
- Runs applications
- Manages memory and storage
- Interfaces with hardware (keyboard, disk, screen, etc.)

## Examples
- Linux, Windows, macOS, Android

## Why Linux for Cybersecurity?
- Open-source (transparent, customizable)
- CLI-focused (automation and control)
- Secure, flexible, popular in servers

## Linux vs Windows

| Feature        | Linux                      | Windows                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Source         | Open-source                 | Proprietary                 |
| Interface      | Command-line preferred      | GUI preferred               |
| File System    | Everything is a file        | C:\, D:\ drive structure    |
| Security       | More secure by default      | More malware targeted       |
| Customization  | Highly customizable         | Limited                     |

## Practice Summary
- Created folder: `cyberlab`
- Inside: Created file `day2.txt`
- Deleted and recreated it using CLI

## Reflections
- First hands-on with Linux CLI
- Commands are case-sensitive
- Will explore `man` and `chmod` next
