# 📡 TryHackMe - Network Fundamentals (Day 3)

## ✅ Room Completed: [Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/room/networkfundamentals)

---
🧠 Key Topics Covered

🔹 1. What is Networking?
Networking = The exchange of data between devices (nodes).

IP addresses identify devices.

Devices communicate using protocols like TCP/IP.

🔹 2. Intro to LAN
LAN (Local Area Network) = Group of connected devices in the same location.

Uses switches, routers.

IP range like 192.168.x.x for internal network communication.

🔹 3. OSI Model
7 Layers:
Application > Presentation > Session > Transport > Network > Data Link > Physical

Helps standardize communication.

Example:

Ping = Network layer (Layer 3)

TCP/UDP = Transport layer (Layer 4)

🔹 4. Packets & Frames
Packets = Structured data sent over networks.

Contain headers (with IP, port info), payload (actual data).

Can be fragmented and reassembled.

🔹 5. Extending Your Network
Use of switches, routers, access points to expand LAN.

WAN (like the internet) = Wide Area Network

NAT helps convert private IPs to public.

🔍 Real-World Skills Learned
You used ipconfig, ping, netstat, traceroute, nslookup

Understood IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6), subnets, gateways

Learned how packets flow and how networks are structured

🧪 Tools Practiced
Windows CMD or Linux terminal

Ping, traceroute, ipconfig / ifconfig

Reading routing and interface details
