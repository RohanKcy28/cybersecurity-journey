## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### 1. What is a Network?

- Group of connected devices that can share data.
- Types: LAN, WAN, WLAN, etc.

### 2. How Data Travels

- Through **Packets**.
- Uses **IP Addresses** and **Ports**.

### 3. OSI Model Layers

- **7 layers** from Physical to Application.
- Helps in understanding where issues occur in networking.

### 4. Common Devices

- **Router**: Connects networks.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN.
- **Firewall**: Filters traffic based on rules.

### 5. IP Addressing

- IPv4 and IPv6 differences.
- Private IP vs Public IP.

### 6. DNS

- Translates domain names to IP addresses.
- Works like the phonebook of the internet.

### 7. TCP vs UDP

- TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented.
- UDP: Faster, connectionless.

### 8. Ports

- Services run on specific ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22, 53, 3389).
